# Minesweeper to WebAssembly

This is a learning project to excercise Test Driven Development and WebAssembly. It does so by implementing a game of minesweeper.

## Installation

I'm building this project on an Ubuntu Linux 18.04 installation. I've installed the G++ build tools and the boost library.

`sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`
